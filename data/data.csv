OID-013,Left,5.8,90,Sport,TR,7-13-2019,y,TID-004,Point Dume,Face,"Emily, Adelaide",SO packed. Terrible time parking. Got nervous setting up and tangled rope on throw.
OID-014,Powder Puff Girls,5.9,40,Sport,Lead,8-3-2019,y,TID-005,Malibu Creek State Park,Power Wall,"Ann, Cole, Alex Chung, J.D., Adelaide",Scary high move before first clip to good hueco. It's all about getting a high left foot. Third clip is a little spooky but better mobility as you move right of the hueco.
OID-015,Electric Eye,5.10C,40,Sport,TR,8-3-2019,n,TID-005,Malibu Creek State Park,Power Wall,"Ann, Cole, Alex Chung, J.D., Adelaide","Carried up the wall but beta was good once it was discovered! Beta: Boulder up the first few moves until you get to the last left hueco. Find a mono or a nub to get you to a left-hand pocket with thumb catch, both chalked. Right hand slips into a deep 3.5 finger undercling pocket. Flag right for a throw to a high left undercling pinch. Switch feet for a balanced throw to 4-pad right hand crimp. Get scrunched up to a big throw for a nice jug to the big hueco up top. Fight your way to the finish over the lip."

OID-021,Claim Jumper,5.8,80,Sport,TR,8-7-2019,n,TID-006,Holcomb Valley Pinnacles,Claim Jumper Wall,Mark,Second attempt. So so so weak. Used crack system on left to avoid crux
OID-022,Green Goblin,5.7,50,Trad,TR,8-7-2019,n,TID-006,Holcomb Valley Pinnacles,Claim Jumper Wall,Mark,"Chimney crack. Desparate struggle up, lots of tries. Overexertion caused trigger finger at the top. Would like to avoid that in future."

OID-025,Corrugation Corner,5.7,300,Trad,Follow,8-13-2019,y,TID-007,Lover's Leap,Main Wall,"Ann, Mark",Very clean climbing. Few technical moves save for chimneys and beached whale. Brought TOO much water!!!
OID-026,The Groove,5.8,150,Trad,Follow,8-13-2019,y,TID-007,Lover's Leap,Lower Buttress,Mark,"Lie-back to shenanigans for the first move. Lots of mantle moves, good practice and confidence booster. One move that I just barely could reach my fingers around."

OID-029,Shiela,5.10B,180,Trad,Follow,8-15-2019,n,TID-007,Pine Creek Canyon,Pratt's Crack,"Ann, Mark",Not a send. Pulled up the wall by Mark. Good hotbed of jamming techniques.

OID-032,Centre Street,5.10C,30,Trad,Follow,8-23-2019,n,TID-008,Squamish,Crag X,Mark,I think we only did the top third of this climb.
OID-033,Picket Line,5.9-,100,Trad,Follow,8-23-2019,n,TID-008,Squamish,Boulder Gulley,Mark,Somehow fell towards the top or middle? I think foot slipped out of a stem. We also probably didn'ta ctually do Picket Line. More likely something  more to the right.
OID-034,Dirty Little White Boys,5.10B,150,Trad,Follow,8-24-2019,n,TID-008,Squamish,Apron,"Mark, Arial",Hardeset slab I've ever done. Had to really work on it to progress. Escaped to RBTL halfway up pitch 1

OID-040,St. Vitus' Dance,5.9,600,Trad,Follow,8-26-2019,n,TID-008,Squamish,Apron,Mark,"Beautiful cracks. I feel like this is my window into the world of beautiful moderates. 3/5 are 5.9 -- my fav climb was P3, just a pure line ending with a scrappy bulge. P4 also had a tough bulge... very difficult for me."
OID-041,Skywalker,5.8,300,Trad,Follow,8-26-2019,n,TID-008,Squamish,Shannon Falls Area,Mark,"Really diversified climbing. Really special stuff. Big big big bulge fight (""thought-provoking move"" - MP) at the top of P3. P2 also had this crack line that was intimidating, but once you figure out the rhythm it goes (""The Flume"")"
OID-042,Skyline Pillar,5.7,40,Sport,Follow,9-9-2019,n,TID-009,Holcomb Valley Pinnacles,Doc Holliday Wall,"Amanda, Enrico, Adelaide","Fell at the bottom. Felt kind of weak, probably because I haven't really pulled on crimps in a long time."

OID-051,Quick on the Draw,5.10D,60,Sport,TR,9-15-2019,n,TID-010,Holcomb Valley Pinnacles,Doc Holliday Wall,Ann,"Start right foot on dish, work left foot to starting rail. Use bad sidepull to cross feet and make your way to a knob. Use the knob to work back right to a worse knob. Not bad climbing after that section."

I was able to use the crux to clip the crux-bolt, but it was a close call. I couldn't progress further from that point."
OID-056,Bum Steer,5.10A,60,Sport,Lead,9-22-2019,n,TID-012,Holcomb Valley Pinnacles,Claim Jumper Wall,Ann,Could have gotten the send if I went left instead of right. This crag is too zig-zaggy
